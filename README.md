# Birds-Classification
The goal of this assignment is to implement a program in the Python programming language that will classify birds in an image from a provided dataset, which contains approximately 7200 images in the training, testing, and validation sets.

First, you have to unzip bird_dataset.zip to folder bird_dataset. This dataset doesnt contain 7200 images (it was too large to upload), but only small part.
